      <h2>What is K-pop?</h2>
      <p>The simplest way to put it is <q>pop music that is in Korean</q>. <br>What makes it so different to English pop? To answer that, I would personally say that it is the dedication that the artists have for their craft. I udnerstand that all artists are decided to their work. But K-pop takes it to the next level.</p>

      <h2>What are K-dramas?</h2>
      <p>Just like K-pop is pop in Korean, K-dramas are dramas that are in Korean. <br>I wouldn't say that they are really any different to English dramas as they are just as dynamtic and over the top sometimes.</p>
