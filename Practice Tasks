    <h1>What's so good about K-dramas and K-pop?</h1>
    <p>They are both Korean and that is about all that they have in common, <del>a part from the OSTs and the occassional idol being in a drama.</del></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"They are pointless. Why not just watch English dramas and listen to English music?"</p>
      <footer>A usual quesiton that I hear all of the time.</footer>

      <!--Adding lang="ko" in the opening tags of elements is another way to make the browser read Korean as well as English if it was not stated in the html tag at the top. I also noticed the difference in font used depending on which method was used. I'm not sure which is better to use.-->
      <li lang= "ko">김소현 Kim SoHyun</li>
      <li lang= "ko">박서준 Park SeoJoon</li>
      <li lang= "ko">박형식 Park HyungSik</li>

    <p>I've not watched many dramas with different leads. So I don't really know that many yet.</p>
    <h1>K-pop</h1>
    <h2>Who are my favorite Korean groups and artists?</h2>
    <p>Here is a small list of my current favourite groups and soloists. I listen to a lot of music, so I will break it into two lists: males and females.</p>
