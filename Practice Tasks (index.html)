      <h2>What is K-pop?</h2>
      <p>The simplest way to put it is <q>pop music that is in Korean</q>. <br>What makes it so different to English pop? To answer that, I would personally say that it is the dedication that the artists have for their craft. Ii udnerstand that all artists are decided to their work. But K-pop takes it to the next level.</p>

      <h2>What are K-dramas?</h2>
      <p>Just like K-pop is pop in Korean, K-dramas are dramas that are in Korean. <br>I wouldn't say that they are really any different to English dramas as they are just as dynamtic and over the top sometimes.</p>

    <h1>What's so good about K-dramas and K-pop?</h1>
    <p>They are both Korean and that is about all that they have in common, <del>a part from the OSTs and the occassional idol being in a drama.</del></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"They are pointless. Why not just watch English dramas and listen to English music?"</p>

    <p>Here is a small list of my current favourite actors and actresses:</p>

      <!--Adding lang="ko" in the opening tags of elements is another way to make the browser read Korean as well as English if it was not stated in the html tag at the top. I also noticed the difference in font used depending on which method was used. I'm not sure which is better to use.-->

    <h2>Who are my favorite Korean groups and artists?</h2>
    <p>Here is a small list of my current favourite groups and soloists. I listen to a lot of music, so I will break it into two lists: males and females.</p>
