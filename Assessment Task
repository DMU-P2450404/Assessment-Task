    <h1>This is a webpage all about me</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Who am I? Well, my name is Abbie Waterson and I am 20 years old.<p>
    <!--A blockqote adds a little information and it will be intended.-->
    <blockquote>
      <p>"But you have the mental age of a 15 year old"</p>
      <footer>My dad</footer>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>My family set-up</h3>
    <p>I am from a family of five, well, six if you include the dog. I am the middle child with an older and younger brother. Our dog will be three this year (her birthday is on Christmas Day!). And that's probably about it for facts about me and my family life that you need or want to know.</p>

    <h2>Some of my favourite things</h2>
    <p>Just some of my favorite songs:</p>
    <!--style=padding changes the space between the side of the screen and the bullet points.-->
    <!--Adding lang="ko" in the opening tags of elements is another way to make the browser read Korean as well as English if it was not stated in the html tag at the top. I also noticed the difference in font used depending on which method was used. I'm not sure which is better to use.-->
